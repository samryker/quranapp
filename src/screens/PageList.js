               "people said to those who were weak,  " +
               "to those who believed from among  " +
               "them: Do you know that ˝åliƒ is one  " +
               "sent by his Lord? They said: Surely  " +
               "we are believers in that wherewith he  " +
               "has been sent.  \n" + "\n" +
   
         "76.  Those who were haughty said:  " +
               "Surely we are disbelievers in that  " +
               "which you believe.  \n" + "\n" +
   
         "77.  Then they hamstrung the shecamel " +
               "and revolted against their  " +
               "Lord’s commandment, and said; O  " +
               "˝åliƒ, bring us that with which thou  " +
               "threatenest us, if thou art of the  " +
               "messengers.  \n" + "\n" +
   
         "78.  So the earthquake seized them,  " +
               "and they were motionless bodies in  " +
               "their abodes.a \n" + "\n" +
   
         "79.  So he turned away from them and  " +
               "said: O my people, I delivered to you  " +
               "the message of my Lord and gave  " +
               "you good advice, but you love not  " +
               "good advisers.a \n" + "\n" +
   
         "80.  And (We sent) Lot, when he said  " +
               "to his people: Do you commit an  " +
               "abomination which no one in the  " +
               "world did before you?a \n" + "\n" +
   
         "81.  Surely you come to males with  " +
               "lust instead of females. Nay, you are  " +
               "a people exceeding bounds.  \n" + "\n" +
   
         "82.  And the answer of his people was  " +
               "no other than that they said: Turn  " +
               "them out of your town; surely they  " +
               "are a people who aspire to purity! \n" + "\n" +
   
         "83.  So We delivered him and his " +
               "followers,a except his wife — she was  " +
               "of those who remained behind. \n" + "\n" +
   
         "84.  And We rained upon them a  " +
               "rain.a See, then, what was the end of  " +
               "the guilty! \n" + "\n" +
   
         "85.  And to Midian (We sent) their " +
               "brother Shu‘aib. He said: O my people, " +
               "serve Allåh, you have no god  " +
               "other than Him. Clear proof indeed  " +
               "has come to you from your Lord, so  " +
               "give full measure and weight and  " +
               "diminish not to men their things, and  " +
               "make not mischief in the land after  " +
               "its reform. This is better for you, if  " +
               "you are believers.a \n" + "\n" +
   
         "86.  And lie not in wait on every road,  " +
               "threatening and turning away from " +
               "Allåh’s way him who believes in Him " +
               "and seeking to make it crooked. And  " +
               "remember when you were few, then  " +
               "He multiplied you, and see what was  " +
               "the end of the mischief-makers! \n" + "\n" +
   
         "87.  And if there is a party of you who  " +
               "believe in that wherewith I am sent  " +
               "and another party who believe not,  " +
               "then wait patiently till Allåh judges  " +
               "between us; and He is the Best of  " +
               "Judges. \n" + "\n" +
   
         "88.  The arrogant chiefs of his people  " +
               "said: We will certainly turn thee out,  " +
               "O Shu‘aib, and those who believe  " +
               "with thee from our town, or you shall  " +
               "come back to our religion. He said:  " +
               "Even though we dislike (it)?  \n" + "\n" +
   
         "89.  Indeed we should have forged a  " +
               "lie against Allåh, if we go back to  " +
               "your religion after Allåh has delivered " +
               "us from it. And it is not for us to  " +
               "go back to it, unless Allåh our Lord  " +
               "please. Our Lord comprehends all  " +
               "things in His knowledge. In Allåh do  " +
               "we trust. Our Lord, decide between  " +
               "us and our people with truth, and  " +
               "Thou art the Best of Deciders. \n" + "\n" +
   
         "90.  And the chiefs of his people, who  " +
               "disbelieved, said: If you follow  " +
               "Shu‘aib, you are surely losers. \n" + "\n" +
   
         "91.  So the earthquake overtook them,  " +
               "and they were motionless  " +
               "bodies in their abodea — \n" + "\n"  +
   
         "92.  Those who called Shu‘aib a liar  " +
               "were as though they had never dwelt  " +
               "therein — those who called Shu‘aib a  " +
               "liar, they were the losers. \n" + "\n" +
   
         "93.  So he turned away from them and  " +
               "said: O my people, indeed I delivered  " +
               "to you the messages of my Lord and  " +
               "I gave you good advice; how, then,  " +
               "should I be sorry for a disbelieving  " +
               "people?a \n" + "\n" +
   
         "94.  And We did not send a prophet to " +
               "a town but We seized its people with  " +
               "distress and affliction that they might  " +
               "humble themselves.a \n" + "\n" +
   
         "95.  Then We changed the evil for  " +
               "good,a till they became affluent and  " +
               "said: Distress and happiness did indeed  " +
               "touch our fathers. So We took them by  " +
               "surprise while they perceived not. \n" + "\n" +
   
         "96.  And if the people of the towns  " +
               "had believed and kept their duty, We  " +
               "would certainly have opened for  " +
               "them blessings from the heavens and  " +
               "the earth. But they rejected, so We  " +
               "seized them for what they earned.  \n" + "\n" +
   
         "97.  Are the people of the towns, then,  " +
               "secure from Our punishment coming  " +
               "to them by night while they sleep? \n" + "\n" +
   
         "98.  Or, are the people of the towns  " +
               "secure from Our punishment coming  " +
               "to them in the morning while they  " +
               "play?a \n" + "\n" +
   
         "99.  Are they secure from Allåh’s  " +
               "plan? But none feels secure from  " +
               "Allåh’s plan except the people who  " +
               "perish. \n" + "\n" +
   
        "100.  Is it not clear to those who  " +
               "inherit the earth after its (former)  " +
               "residents that, if We please, We would  " +
               "afflict them for their sins, and seal  " +
               "their hearts so they would not hear? \n" + "\n" +
   
        "101.  Such were the towns some of  " +
               "whose news We have related to thee.  " +
               "And certainly their messengers came  " +
               "to them with clear arguments, but  " +
               "they would not believe what they had  " +
               "rejected before. Thus does Allåh seal  " +
               "the hearts of the disbelievers. \n" + "\n" +
   
        "102.  And We found not in most of  " +
               "them (faithfulness to) covenant; and  " +
               "We found most of them to be transgressors. \n" + "\n" +
   
        "103.  Then, after them, We sent  " +
               "Moses with Our messages to Pharaoh  " +
               "and his chiefs, but they disbelieved  " +
               "them. See, then, what was the end of  " +
               "the mischief-makers!a \n" + "\n" +
   
        "104.  And Moses said: O Pharaoh,  " +
               "surely I am a messenger from the  " +
               "Lord of the worlds,  \n" + "\n" +
   
        "105.  Worthy of not saying anything  " +
               "about Allåh except the truth. I have  " +
               "come to you indeed with clear proof  " +
               "from your Lord, so let the Children  " +
               "of Israel go with me. \n" + "\n" +
        
        "106.  He said: If thou hast come with  " +
               "a sign, produce it, if thou art truthful. \n" + "\n" +
        
        "107.  So he threw his rod, then lo! it  " +
               "was a serpent manifest. \n" + "\n" +
        
        "108.  And he drew forth his hand, and  " +
               "lo! it was white to the beholders.a \n" + "\n" +
        
        "109.  The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people  " +
               "said: Surely this is a skilful enchanter! \n" + "\n" +
        
        "110.  He intends to turn you out of  " +
               "your land. What do you advise?a \n" + "\n" +
        
        "111.  They said: Put him off and his  " +
               "brother, and send summoners into the  " +
               "cities, \n" + "\n" +
        
        "112.  To bring to thee every skilful  " +
               "enchanter. \n" + "\n" +
        
        "113.  And the enchanters came to  " +
               "Pharaoh, saying: We must surely  " +
               "have a reward if we prevail.a \n" + "\n" +
        
        "114.  He said: Yes, and you shall " +
               "certainly be of those who are near (to  " +
               "me). \n" + "\n" +
        
        "115.  They said: O Moses, wilt thou  " +
               "cast, or shall we (be the first to) cast? \n" + "\n" +
        
        "116.  He said: Cast. So when they  " +
               "cast, they deceived the people’s eyes  " +
               "and overawed them, and they " +
               "produced a mighty enchantment. \n" + "\n" +
        
        "117.  And We revealed to Moses:  " +
               "Cast thy rod. Then lo! it swallowed  " +
               "up their lies.a \n" + "\n" +
   
        "118.  So the truth was established,  " +
               "and that which they did became null. \n" + "\n"  +
   
        "119.  There they were vanquished,  " +
               "and they went back abased. \n" + "\n" +
        
        "120.  And the enchanters fell down  " +
               "prostrate —  \n" + "\n" +
        
        "121.  They said: We believe in the  " +
               "Lord of the worlds, \n" + "\n" +
        
        "122.  The Lord of Moses and Aaron. \n" + "\n" +
        
        "123.  Pharaoh said: You believe in  " +
               "Him before I give you permission!  " +
               "Surely this is a plot which you have  " +
               "plotted in the city, to turn out of it its  " +
               "people, but you shall know! \n" + "\n" +
        
        "124.  I shall certainly cut off your  " +
               "hands and your feet on opposite  " +
               "sides, then I shall crucify you all  " +
               "together! \n" + "\n" +
        
        "125.  They said: Surely to our Lord  " +
               "do we return. \n" + "\n" +
        
        "126.  And thou takest revenge on us  " +
               "only because we believed in the messages " +
               "of our Lord when they came to  " +
               "us. Our Lord, pour out on us patience  " +
               "and cause us to die in submission (to  " +
               "Thee)!a \n" + "\n" +
   
        "127.  And the chiefs of Pharaoh’s  " +
               "people said: Wilt thou leave Moses  " +
               "and his people to make mischief in  " +
               "the land and forsake thee and thy  " +
               "gods? He said: We will slay their  " +
               "sons and spare their women, and  " +
               "surely we are dominant over them.a \n" + "\n" +
   
        "128.  Moses said to his people: Ask  " +
               "help from Allah and be patient.  " +
               "Surely the land is Allåh’s — He  " +
               "gives it for an inheritance to such of  " +
               "His servants as He pleases. And the  " +
               "end is for those who keep their duty. \n" + "\n" +
   
        "129.  They said: We were persecuted  " +
               "before thou camest to us and since  " +
               "thou hast come to us. He said: It may  " +
               "be that your Lord will destroy your  " +
               "enemy and make you rulers in the  " +
               "land, then He will see how you act.a \n" + "\n" +
   
        "130.  And certainly We overtook  " +
               "Pharaoh’s people with droughts and  " +
               "diminution of fruits that they might  " +
               "be mindful. \n" + "\n" +
   
        "131.  But when good befell them they  " +
               "said: This is due to us. And when evil  " +
               "afflicted them, they attributed it to  " +
               "the ill-luck of Moses and those with  " +
               "him. Surely their evil fortune is only  " +
               "from Allåh, but most of them know  " +
               "not.a \n" + "\n" +
   
        "132.  And they said: Whatever sign  " +
               "thou mayest bring to us to charm us  " +
               "therewith — we shall not believe in  " +
               "thee. \n" + "\n" +
   
        "133.  So We sent upon them widespread " +
               "death,a and the locusts and the  " +
               "lice and the frogs and the blood  " +
               "— clear signs.b But they behaved  " +
               "haught ily and they were a guilty  " +
               "people.  \n" + "\n" +
   
        "134.  And when the plaguea fell upon  " +
               "them, they said: O Moses, pray for us  " +
               "to thy Lord as He has made promise  " +
               "with thee. If thou remove the plague  " +
               "from us, we will certainly believe in  " +
               "thee and will let the Children of  " +
               "Israel go with thee. \n" + "\n" +
   
        "135.  But when We removed the  " +

               "(their promise).a \n" + "\n" +
   
        "136.  So We exacted retribution from  " +
               "them and drowned them in the sea,  " +
               "because they rejected Our signs and  " +
               "were heedless of them. \n" + "\n" +
   
        "137.  And We made the people who  " +
               "were deemed weak to inherit the  " +
               "eastern lands and the western ones  " +
               "which We had blessed. And the good  " +
               "word of thy Lord was fulfilled in the  " +
               "Children of Israel — because of their  " +
               "patience. And We destroyed what  " +

               "and what they had built.a \n" + "\n" +
   
        "138.  And We took the Children of  " +
               "Israel across the sea. Then they came  " +
               "to a people who were devoted to their  " +
               "idols. They said: O Moses, make for  " +

               "you to severe torment, killing your  " +
               "sons and sparing your women. And  " +

               "with ten, so the appointed time of his  " +
               "Lord was complete forty nights. And  " +
               "Moses said to his brother Aaron:  " +
               "Take my place among my people,  " +
               "and act well and follow not the way  " +
               "of the mischief-makers. \n" + "\n" +
               
        "143.  And when Moses came at Our  " +

               "firm in its place, then wilt thou see  " +

                  "Noah, when he said to his people: O  " +
                  "my people, if my staying (here) and  " +
                  "my reminding (you) by the messages  " +
                  "of Allåh is hard on you, on Allåh do I  " +
                  "rely; so decide upon your course of  " +
                  "action and (gather) your associates. " +
                  "Then let not your course of action be  " +
                  "dubious to you, so have it executed  " +
                  "against me and give me no respite.a \n" + "\n" +
           
           "72.   But if you turn back, I ask for no  " +
                  "reward from you. My reward is only  " +
                  "with Allåh, and I am commanded to  " +

           "73.   But they rejected him, so We  " +
                  "delivered him and those with him in  " +
                  "the ark, and We made them rulers  " +
                  "and drowned those who rejected Our  " +
                  "messages. See, then, what was the  " +
                  "end of those who were warned. \n" + "\n" +
           
           "74.   Then, after him We sent messengers " +
                  "to their people. They came to  " +
                  "them with clear arguments, but they  " +
                  "would not believe what they had  " +
                  "rejected before. Thus do We seal the  " +

           "75.   Then after them We sent Moses  " +
                  "and Aaron to Pharaoh and his chiefs  " +
                  "with Our signs, but they were arrogant, " +
                  "and they were a guilty people. \n" + "\n" +
           
           "76.   So when the truth came to them  " +
                  "from Us, they said: This is surely clear  " +
                  "enchantment! \n" + "\n" +
           
           "77.   Moses said: Say you (this) of the  " +
                  "truth when it has come to you? Is it  " +
                  "enchantment? And the enchanters  " +
                  "never succeed. \n" + "\n" +
           
           "78.   They said: Hast thou come to us  " +
                  "to turn us away from that which we  " +

           "79.   And Pharaoh said: Bring to me  " +
                  "every skilful enchanter. \n" + "\n" +

           "80.   So when the enchanters came,  " +
                  "Moses said to them: Cast what you  " +
                  "are going to cast. \n" + "\n" +
           
           "81.   So when they had cast down,  " +
                  "Moses said: What you have brought  " +
                  "is deception. Surely Allåh will make  " +
                  "it naught. Surely Allåh allows not the  " +

           "82.   And Allåh will establish the truth  " +

                  "Pharaoh and their chiefs persecuting  " +
                  "them, none believed in Moses except  " +
                  "a few of his people. And Pharaoh  " +
                  "was truly high-handed in the land;  " +
                  "and surely he was extravagant.a \n" + "\n" +
           
           "84.   And Moses said: O my people, if  " +
                  "you believe in Allåh, then rely on  " +
                  "Him if you submit (to Him). \n" + "\n" +
           
           "85.   They said: On Allåh we rely; our  " +

                  "unjust people. \n" + "\n" +

           "87.   And We revealed to Moses and  " +
                  "his brother: Take for your people  " +
                  "houses to abide in Egypt and make  " +

                  "to the believers. \n" + "\n" +
           
           "88.   And Moses said: Our Lord, surely  " +
                  "Thou hast given Pharaoh and his  " +
                  "chiefs finery and riches in this  " +

           "90.   And We brought the Children of  " +
                  "Israel across the sea. Then Pharaoh  " +
                  "and his hosts followed them for  " +
                  "oppression and tyranny, till, when  " +

                  "and provided them with good things.  " +

                  "curse in this world and on the day of  " +
                  "Resurrection. Now surely ‘Åd disbelieved " +

                  "than Him. He brought you forth from  " +
                  "the earth and made you dwell in it, so  " +
                  "ask forgiveness of Him, then turn to  " +

                  "before this. Dost thou forbid us to  " +
                  "worship what our fathers worshipped?  " +
                  "And surely we are in grave doubt  " +
                  "about that to which thou callest us. \n" + "\n" +
          
           "63.   He said: O my people, see you if  " +
                  "I have clear proof from my Lord and  " +
                  "He has granted me mercy from  " +

                  "against Allåh, if I disobey Him? So  " +
                  "you would add to me naught but  " +

           "64.   And, O my people, this is Allåh’s  " +
                  "she-camel,a a sign for you, so leave  " +
                  "her to pasture on Allåh’s earth and  " +

           "65.  But they hamstrung her, so he  " +

                  "They said: Peace! Peace! said he.  " +

                  "and conceived fear of them. They  " +

           "72.   She said: O wonder!a Shall I bear  " +
                  "a son when I am an extremely old  " +
                  "woman, and this my husband an  " +

           "73.   They said: Wonderest thou at  " +
                  "Allåh’s commandment? The mercy  " +
                  "of Allåh and His blessings on you, O  " +

                  "Praised, Glorious. \n" + "\n" +
          
           "74.   So when fear departed from  " +
                  "Abraham and good news came to  " +
                  "him, he began to plead with Us for  " +

                  "Allåh).  \n" + "\n" +
          
           "76.   O Abraham, cease from this.  " +
                  "Surely the decree of thy Lord has gone  " +

           "77.   And when Our messengers came  " +
                  "to Lot, he was grieved for them, and  " +

                  "said: This is a distressful day! \n" + "\n" +
          
           "78.   And his people came to him, (as  " +

                  "were used to the doing of evil deeds  " +
                  "before. He said: O my people, these  " +

                  "and thou knowest what we desire. \n" + "\n" +
               
           "80.   He said: Would that I had the  " +

                  "have recourse to a strong support.a \n" + "\n" +
          
           "81.   They said: O Lot, we are the  " +

                  "not reach thee. So travel with thy  " +

           "82.   So when Our decree came to  " +
                  "pass, We turned them upside down,a " +
                  "and rained on them stones,b as  " +

                  "This is our property returned to us, " +

                  "he was possessed of knowledge, " +

           "73.   They said: By Allåh! You know " +
                  "for certain that we have not come to " +
                  "make mischief in the land, and we " +

           "75.   They said: The penalty for this — " +
                  "the person in whose bag it is found, " +
                  "he himself is the penalty for it. Thus " +
                  "do we punish the wrongdoers. \n" + "\n" +

                  "before the sack of his brother,a then " +
                  "he brought it out from his brother’s " +

                  "Joseph kept it secret in his soul, and " +

                  "controlling naught, and there is one  " +

                  "Are the two alike?a Praise be to  " +
                  "Allåh! Nay, most of them know not. \n" + "\n" +
      
           "76.   And Allåh sets forth a parable of  " +
                  "two men: One of them dumb, controlling " +
                  "naught, and he is a burden to  " +
                  "his master; wherever he sends him,  " +
                  "he brings no good. Is he equal with  " +

                  "himself. \n" + "\n" +

                  "which We send down from the cloud,  " +

                  "asked its people for food, but they  " +
                  "refused to entertain them as guests.  " +
                  "Then they found in it a wall which  " +
                  "was on the point of falling, so he put it  " +

           "78.   He said: This is the parting  " +

           "79.   As for the boat, it belonged to  " +
                  "poor people working on the river,  " +
                  "and I intended to damage it, for there  " +

                  "Myself.  \n" + "\n" +
      
              "42. Go thou and thy brother with My  " +

                  "remembering Me.  \n" + "\n" +
      
              "43. Go both of you to Pharaoh, surely  " +
                  "he is inordinate;  \n" + "\n" +
      
              "44. Then speak to him a gentle word,  " +
                  "haply he may mind or fear. \n" + "\n" +
      
              "45. They said: Our Lord, we fear lest  " +
                  "he hasten to do evil to us or be inordinate. \n" + "\n" +
      
              "46. He said: Fear not, surely I am  " +
                  "with you — I do hear and see. \n" + "\n" +
      
              "47. So go you to him and say: Surely  " +
                  "we are two messengers of thy Lord;  " +
                  "so send forth the Children of Israel  " +
                  "with us; and torment them not.  " +
                  "Indeed we have brought to thee a  " +
                  "message from thy Lord, and peace to  " +
                  "him who follows the guidance.  \n" + "\n" +
      
              "48. It has indeed been revealed to us  " +
                  "that punishment will overtake him  " +
                  "who rejects and turns away.a \n" + "\n" +
      
              "49. (Pharaoh) said: Who is your  " +
                  "Lord, O Moses? \n" + "\n" +
      
              "50. He said: Our Lord is He Who  " +
                  "gives to everything its creation, then  " +
                  "guides (it).a \n" + "\n" +
      
              "51. He said: What then is the state of  " +
                  "the former generations? \n" + "\n" +
      
              "52. He said: The knowledge thereof  " +
                  "is with my Lord in a book; my Lord  " +
                  "neither errs nor forgets — \n" + "\n" +
      
              "53. Who made the earth for you an  " +
                  "expanse and made for you therein  " +
                  "paths and sent down water from the  " +
                  "clouds. Then thereby We bring forth  " +
                  "pairs of various herbs.  \n" + "\n" +
      
              "54. Eat and pasture your cattle.  " +
                  "Surely there are signs in this for men  " +
                  "of understanding.  \n" + "\n" +
      
              "55. From it We created you, and into  " +
                  "it We shall return you, and from it  " +
                  "raise you a second time. \n" + "\n" +
      
              "56. And truly We showed him all Our  " +
                  "signs but he rejected and refused. \n" + "\n" +
      
              "57. Said he: Hast thou come to us to  " +
                  "turn us out of our land by thy  " +
                  "enchantment, O Moses? \n" + "\n" +
      
              "58. We too can bring to thee enchantment " +
                  "like it, so make an appointment  " +
                  "between us and thee, which we break  " +

              "59. (Moses) said: Your appointment  " +
                  "is the day of the Festival, and let the  " +
                  "people be gathered in the early fore - " +
                  "noon.  \n" + "\n" +
      
              "60. So Pharaoh went back and settled  " +
                  "his plan, then came. \n" + "\n" +
      
              "61. Moses said to them: Woe to you!  " +
                  "Forge not a lie against Allåh, lest He  " +
                  "destroy you by punishment, and he  " +
                  "fails indeed who forges (a lie). \n" + "\n" +
      
              "62. So they disputed one with another about " +
                  "their affair and kept the discourse secret. \n" + "\n" +
      
              "63. They said: These are surely two  " +
                  "enchanters who would drive you out  " +
                  "from your land by their enchantment,  " +
                  "and destroy your excellent institutions. \n" + "\n" +
      
              "64. So settle your plan, then come in  " +
                  "ranks, and he will succeed indeed  " +
                  "this day who is uppermost.  \n" + "\n" +
      
              "65. They said: O Moses, wilt thou  " +
                  "cast, or shall we be the first to cast  " +
                  "down? \n" + "\n" +
      
              "66. He said: Nay! Cast you down.  " +
                  "Then lo! their cords and their rods —  " +
                  "it appeared to him by their enchantment as if they ran.a \n" + "\n" +
      
              "67. So Moses conceived fear in his  " +
                  "mind.a \n" + "\n" +
      
              "68. We said: Fear not, surely thou art  " +
                  "the uppermost.  \n" + "\n" +
      
              "69. And cast down what is in thy  " +
                  "right hand — it will eat up what they  " +
                  "have wrought. What they have  " +
                  "wrought is only the trick of an  " +
                  "enchanter, and the enchanter succeeds  " +
                  "not wheresoever he comes from. \n" + "\n" +
      
              "70. So the enchanters fell down prostrate, " +
                  "saying: We believe in the Lord  " +
                  "of Aaron and Moses. \n" + "\n" +
      
              "71. (Pharaoh) said: You believe in  " +
                  "him before I give you leave! Surely  " +
                  "he is your chief who taught you  " +
                  "enchantment. So I shall cut off your  " +
                  "hands and your feet on opposite sides  " +
                  "and I shall crucify you on the trunks  " +
                  "of palm-trees, and you shall certainly  " +
                  "know which of us can give the severer " +
                  "and the more abiding chastisement. \n" + "\n" +
      
              "72. They said: We cannot prefer thee  " +
                  "to what has come to us of clear arguments " +
                  "and to Him Who made us, so  " +
                  "decide as thou wilt decide. Thou canst  " +
                  "only decide about this world’s life. \n" + "\n" +
      
              "73. Surely we believe in our Lord that  " +
                  "He may forgive us our faults and the  " +
                  "magic to which thou didst compel us.  " +
                  "And Allåh is Best and ever Abiding. \n" + "\n" +
      
              "74. Whoso comes guilty to his Lord,  " +
                  "for him is surely hell. He will neither  " +
                  "die therein, nor live.a \n" + "\n" +
      
              "75. And whoso comes to Him a  " +
                  "believer, having done good deeds, for  " +
                  "them are high ranks — \n" + "\n" +
      
              "76. Gardens of perpetuity, wherein  " +
                  "flow rivers, to abide therein. And  " +
                  "such is the reward of him who  " +
                  "purifies himself.  \n" + "\n" +
      
              "77. And certainly We revealed to  " +
                  "Moses: Travel by night with My servants, " +
                  "then strike for them a dry path " +
                  "in the sea, not fearing to be " + 
                  "overtaken, nor being afraid.a \n" + "\n" +
      
              "78. So Pharaoh followed them with  " +
                  "his armies, then there covered them  " +
                  "of the sea that which covered them.  \n" + "\n" +
      
              "79. And Pharaoh led his people  " +
                  "astray and he guided not aright.  \n" + "\n" +
      
              "80.  O Children of Israel, We truly  " +
                  "delivered you from your enemy, and  " +
                  "made a covenant with you on the  " +
                  "blessed side of the mountain, and  " +
                  "sent to you the manna and the quails.  \n" + "\n" +
      
              "81. Eat of the good things We have  " +
                  "provided for you, and be not inordinate " +
                  "in respect thereof, lest My wrath  " +
                  "come upon you; and he on whom My  " +
                  "wrath comes, he perishes indeed. \n" + "\n" +
      
              "82. And surely I am Forgiving  " +
                  "toward him who repents and believes  " +
                  "and does good, then walks aright. \n" + "\n" +
      
              "83. And what made thee hasten from  " +
                  "thy people, O Moses?  \n" + "\n" +
      
              "84. He said: They are here on my  " +
                  "track, and I hastened on to Thee, my  " +
                  "Lord, that Thou mightest be pleased. \n" + "\n" +
      
              "85. He said: Surely We have tried thy  " +
                  "people in thy absence, and the Såmirß  " +
                  "has led them astray.a \n" + "\n" +
      
              "86. So Moses returned to his people  " +
                  "angry, sorrowing. He said: O my people, " +
                  "did not your Lord promise you a  " +
                  "goodly promise? Did the promised  " +
                  "time, then, seem long to you, or did  " +
                  "you wish that displeasure from your  " +
                  "Lord should come upon you, so that  " +
                  "you broke (your) promise to me?  \n" + "\n" +
      
              "87. They said: We broke not the  " +
                  "promise to thee of our own accord, but  " +
                  "we were made to bear the burdens of  " +
                  "the ornaments of the people, then we  " +
                  "cast them away, and thus did the  " +
                  "Såmirß suggest.a \n" + "\n" +
      
              "88. Then he brought forth for them a  " +
                  "calf, a body, which had a hollow  " +
                  "sound, so they said: This is your god  " +
                  "and the god of Moses; but he forgot.a \n" + "\n" +
      
              "89. Could they not see that it returned  " +
                  "no reply to them, nor controlled any  " +
                  "harm or benefit for them?a \n" + "\n" +
      
              "90. And Aaron indeed had said to  " +
                  "them before: O my people, you are  " +
                  "only tried by it, and surely your Lord  " +
                  "is the Beneficent God, so follow me  " +
                  "and obey my order.a \n" + "\n" +
      
              "91. They said: We shall not cease to  " +

                  "returns to us. \n" + "\n" +
      
              "92. (Moses) said: O Aaron, what prevented " +
                  "thee, when thou sawest them  " +
                  "going astray, \n" + "\n" +
      
              "93. That thou didst not follow me?  " +
                  "Hast thou, then, disobeyed my order? \n" + "\n" +
      
              "94. He said: O son of my mother,  " +
                  "seize me not by my beard, nor by my  " +
                  "head. Surely I was afraid lest thou  " +
                  "shouldst say: Thou hast caused division " +
                  "among the Children of Israel  " +
                  "and not waited for my word. \n" + "\n" +
      
              "95. (Moses) said: What was thy  " +
                  "object, O Såmirß? \n" + "\n" +
      
              "96. He said: I perceived what they  " +
                  "perceived not, so I took a handful  " +
                  "from the footprints of the messenger  " +
                  "then I cast it away. Thus did my soul  " +
                  "embellish (it) to me.a \n" + "\n" +
      
              "97. He said: Begone then! It is for  " +
                  "thee in this life to say, Touch (me)  " +
                  "not. And for thee is a promise which  " +

                  "an Arabic Qur’ån, and have distinctly  " +
                  "set forth therein of threats that they  " +

                  "the King, the Truth. And make not  " +
                  "haste with the Qur’ån before its revelation " +
                  "is made complete to thee, and say:  " +
                  "My Lord, increase me in knowledge.a \n" + "\n" +
      
              "115. And certainly We gave a commandment " +
                  "to Adam before, but he  " +
                  "forgot; and We found in him no  " +
                  "resolve (to disobey).a  \n" + "\n" +
      
              "116. And when We said to the  " +
                  "angels: Be submissive to Adam, they  " +
                  "submitted except Iblßs; he refused. \n" + "\n" +
      
              "117. We said: O Adam, this is an  " +
                  "enemy to thee and to thy wife; so let  " +
                  "him not drive you both out of the  " +
                  "garden so that thou art unhappy. \n" + "\n" +
      
              "118. Surely it is granted to thee therein  " +
                  "that thou art not hungry, nor naked, \n" + "\n" +

              "120. But the devil made an evil suggestion " +
                  "to him; he said: O Adam, shall  " +
                  "I lead thee to the tree of immortality  " +
                  "and a kingdom which decays not?  \n" + "\n" +
      
              "121. So they both ate of it, then their  " +
                  "evil inclinations became manifest to  " +
                  "them, and they began to cover themselves " +

                  "surely come to you guidance from Me;  " +
                  "then whoever follows My guidance,  " +

              "127. And thus do We recompense  " +
                  "him who is extravagant and believes  " +

                  "many of the generations, in whose  " +
                  "dwellings they go about, We destroyed  " +

                  "from the town which wrought abomination. " +
                  "Surely they were an evil people, transgressors; \n" + "\n" +

              "76. And Noah, when he cried aforetime, \n" + "\n" +

                  "delivered him and his people from  " +
                  "the great calamity. \n" + "\n" +
       
              "77. And We helped him against the  " +
                  "people who rejected Our messages.  " +
                  "Surely they were an evil people, so  " +
                  "We drowned them all. \n" + "\n" +
       
              "78. And David and Solomon, when  " +
                  "they gave judgment concerning the  " +
                  "field, when the people’s sheep strayed  " +

              "82. And of the devils there were  " +
                  "those who dived for him and did  " +
                  "other work besides that; and We kept  " +
                  "guard over them:a \n" + "\n" +
       
              "83. And Job, when he cried to his  " +
                  "Lord: Distress has afflicted me! and  " +
                  "Thou art the most Merciful of those  " +
                  "who show mercy.  \n" + "\n" +
       
              "84. So We responded to him and  " +
                  "removed the distress he had, and We  " +
                  "gave him his people and the like of  " +

              "85. And Ishmael and Idrßs and Dhu-lKifl; " +
                  "all were of the patient ones;a \n" + "\n" +
       
              "86. And We admitted them to Our  " +

                  "ones. \n" + "\n" +
       
              "87. And Dhu-l-N∂n,a when he went  " +
                  "away in wrath,b and he thought that  " +
                  "We would not straiten him,c so he " +

                  "Surely I am of the sufferers of loss.e \n" + "\n" +
       
              "88. So We responded to him and  " +
                  "delivered him from grief. And thus  " +
                  "do We deliver the believers. \n" + "\n" +
       
              "89. And Zacharias, when he cried to his  " +
                  "Lord: My Lord, leave me not alone!  " +
                  "and Thou art the Best of inheritors.a \n" + "\n" +

                  "and they were humble before Us. \n" + "\n" +
       
              "91. And she who guarded her chastity, " +

                  "of this; nay, we were unjust.a \n" + "\n" +

              "24.  But the chiefs of those who  " +
                  "disbelieved from among his people said:  " +
                  "He is nothing but a mortal like yourselves, " +
                  "who desires to have superiority over you. " +
                  "And if Allåh had pleased,  " +
                  "He could have sent down angels. We  " +
                  "have not heard of this among our  " +
                  "fathers of yore. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "25.  He is only a madman, so bear  " +
                  "with him for a time. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "26.  He said: My Lord, help me  " +
                  "against their calling me a liar. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "27.  So We revealed to him: Make the  " +
                  "ark under Our eyes and according to  " +
                  "Our revelation; then when Our command " +
                  "comes, and water gushes forth  " +
                  "from the valley, take into it of every  " +
                  "kind a pair, two,a and thy people,  " +
                  "except those among them against  " +
                  "whom the word has gone forth, and  " +
                  "speak not to Me in respect of those  " +
                  "who are unjust; surely they will be  " +
                  "drowned. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "28.  Then when thou art firmly seated,  " +
                  "thou and those with thee, in the ark,  " +
                  "say: Praise be to Allåh, Who delivered " +
                  "us from the unjust people!  \n" + "\n" +
          
              "29.  And say: My Lord, cause me to  " +
                  "land a blessed landing and Thou art  " +
                  "the Best of those who bring to land. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "30.  Surely there are signs in this, and  " +
                  "surely We are ever trying (men). \n" + "\n" +
          
              "31.  Then We raised after them another generation.  \n" + "\n" +
          
              "32.  So We sent among them a messenger " +
                  "from among them, saying:  " +
                  "Serve Allåh — you have no God  " +
                  "other than Him. Will you not guard  " +
                  "against evil?   \n" + "\n" +
          
              "33.  And the chiefs of his people who  " +
                  "disbelieved and called the meeting of  " +
                  "the Hereafter a lie, and whom We had  " +
                  "given plenty to enjoy in this world’s  " +
                  "life, said: This is only a mortal like  " +
                  "you, eating of that whereof you eat  " +
                  "and drinking of what you drink.a \n" + "\n" +
          
              "34.  And if you obey a mortal like  " +
                  "yourselves, then surely you are losers.  \n" + "\n" +
          
              "35.  Does he promise you that, when  " +
                  "you are dead and become dust and  " +
                  "bones, you will then be brought forth?  \n" + "\n" +
          
              "36.  Far, very far, is that which you  " +
                  "are promised: \n" + "\n" +
          
              "37. There is naught but our life in  " +
                  "this world: we die and we live and  " +
                  "we shall not be raised again:  \n" + "\n" +
          
              "38. He is naught but a man who has  " +
                  "forged a lie against Allåh, and we are  " +
                  "not going to believe in him. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "39. He said: My Lord, help me  " +
                  "against their calling me a liar. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "40. He said: In a little while they will  " +
                  "certainly be repenting. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "41. So the punishment overtook them  " +
                  "in justice, and We made them as rubbish; " +
                  "so away with the unjust people!a \n" + "\n" +
          
              "42. Then We raised after them other  " +
                  "generations. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "43. No people can hasten on their  " +
                  "doom, nor can they postpone (it). \n" + "\n" +
          
              "44. Then We sent Our messengers  " +
                  "one after another. Whenever its messenger " +
                  "came to a people, they called  " +
                  "him a liar, so We made them follow  " +
                  "one another and We made them stories. " +
                  "So away with a people who  " +
                  "believe not!a \n" + "\n" +
          
              "45. Then We sent Moses and his  " +
                  "brother Aaron with Our messages  " +
                  "and a clear authority  \n" + "\n" +
          
              "46. To Pharaoh and his chiefs, but  " +
                  "they behaved haughtily and they  " +
                  "were an insolent people. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "47. So they said: Shall we believe in  " +
                  "two mortals like ourselves while their  " +
                  "people serve us? \n" + "\n" +
          
              "48. So they rejected them and  " +
                  "became of those who were destroyed. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "49. And certainly We gave Moses the  " +
                  "Book that they might go aright. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "50. And We made the son of Mary  " +
                  "and his mother a sign, and We gave  " +
                  "them refuge on a lofty ground having  " +
                  "meadows and springs.a  \n" + "\n" +
          
              "51. O ye messengers, eat of the good  " +
                  "things and do good. Surely I am  " +
                  "Knower of what you do. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "52. And surely this your community  " +
                  "is one community, and I am your  " +
                  "Lord, so keep your duty to Me. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "53. But they became divided into  " +
                  "sects, each party rejoicing in that  " +
                  "which was with them.  \n" + "\n" +
          
              "54. So leave them in their ignorance  " +
                  "till a time. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "55. Think they that by the wealth and  " +
                  "children wherewith We aid them, \n" + "\n" +
          
              "56. We are hastening to them of good  " +
                  "things? Nay, they perceive not.  \n" + "\n" +
          
              "57. Surely they who live in awe for  " +
                  "fear of their Lord,  \n" + "\n" +
          
              "58. And those who believe in the  " +
                  "messages of their Lord, \n" + "\n" +
          
              "59. And those who associate naught  " +
                  "with their Lord, \n" + "\n" +
          
              "60. And those who give what they  " +
                  "give while their hearts are full of fear  " +
                  "that to their Lord they must return — \n" + "\n" +
          
              "61. These hasten to good things and  " +
                  "they are foremost in attaining them. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "62. And We lay not on any soul a burden " +
                  "except to the extent of its ability,  " +
                  "and with Us is a book which speaks  " +
                  "the truth, and they are not wronged. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "63. Nay, their hearts are in ignorance  " +
                  "about it, and they have besides this  " +
                  "other deeds which they do.  \n" + "\n" +
          
              "64. Until, when We seize those who  " +
                  "lead easy lives among them with chastisement, " +
                  "lo! they cry for succour. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "65. Cry not for succour this day.  " +
                  "Surely you will not be helped by Us. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "66. My messages were indeed recited  " +
                  "to you, but you used to turn back on  " +
                  "your heels \n" + "\n" +
          
              "67. Haughtily, passing nights in " +
                  "talking nonsense about it. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "68. Do they not then ponder the  " +
                  "Word? Or has there come to them  " +
                  "that which did not come to their  " +
                  "fathers of old? \n" + "\n" +
          
              "69. Or do they not recognize their  " +
                  "Messenger, that they deny him? \n" + "\n" +
          
              "70. Or say they: There is madness in  " +
                  "him? Nay, he has brought them the  " +
                  "Truth, and most of them hate the  " +
                  "Truth. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "71. And if the Truth follow their  " +
                  "desires, the heavens and the earth and  " +
                  "all those who are therein would perish. " +
                  "Nay, We have brought them their  " +
                  "reminder, but they turn away from  " +
                  "their reminder.  \n" + "\n" +
          
              "72. Or dost thou ask them a recompense? " +
                  "But the recompense of thy  " +
                  "Lord is best, and He is the Best of  " +
                  "providers. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "73. And surely thou callest them to a  " +
                  "right way.  \n" + "\n" +
          
              "74. And surely those who believe not  " +
                  "in the Hereafter are deviating from  " +
                  "the way. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "75. And if We show mercy to them  " +
                  "and remove the distress they have,  " +
                  "they would persist in their inordinacy, " +
                  "blindly wandering on. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "76. And already We seized them with  " +
                  "chastisement, but they were not submissive " +
                  "to their Lord, nor did they  " +
                  "humble themselves.a \n" + "\n" +
          
              "77. Until, when We open for them a  " +

                  "are in despair at it.a \n" + "\n" +
          
              "78. And He it is Who made for you  " +

                  "Little it is that you give thanks! \n" + "\n" +
          
              "79. And He it is Who multiplied you  " +

              "81. Nay, they say the like of what the  " +
                  "ancients said. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "82. They say: When we die and  " +

              "83. We are indeed promised this, and  " +
                  "(so were) our fathers before. This is  " +
                  "naught but stories of those of old!  \n" + "\n" +

              "86. Say: Who is the Lord of the  " +

              "91. Allåh has not taken to Himself a  " +

                  "Solomon, he said: Will you help me  " +
                  "with wealth? But what Allåh has  " +
                  "given me is better than that which He  " +

              "41. He said: Alter her throne for her;  " +
                  "we may see whether she follows the  " +

              "42. So when she came, it was said:  " +
                  "Was thy throne like this? She said: It  " +
                  "is as it were the same; and we were  " +

                  "was of a disbelieving people. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "44. It was said to her: Enter the  " +
                  "palace. But when she saw it she  " +
                  "deemed it to be a great expanse of  " +
                  "water, and prepared herself to meet  " +
                  "the difficulty.a He said: Surely it is a  " +
                  "palace made smooth with glass.b She  " +
                  "said: My Lord, surely I have wronged  " +
                  "myself, and I submit with Solomon to  " +
                  "Allåh, the Lord of the worlds.c \n" + "\n" +
          
              "45. And certainly We sent to Tham∂d  " +
                  "their brother ˝åliƒ, saying: Serve  " +
                  "Allåh. Then lo! they became two  " +
                  "parties, contending.  \n" + "\n" +
          
              "46. He said: O my people, why do you  " +
                  "hasten on the evil before the good?  " +
                  "Why do you not ask forgiveness of  " +

              "47. They said: We augur evil of thee  " +
                  "and those with thee. He said: Your  " +
                  "evil augury is with Allåh; nay, you  " +
                  "are a people who are tried. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "48. And there were in the city nine  " +
                  "persons who made mischief in the  " +
                  "land and did not act aright.a \n" + "\n" +
          
              "49. They said: Swear one to another  " +
                  "by Allåh that we shall attack him and  " +
                  "his family by night, then we shall say  " +
                  "to his heir: We witnessed not the  " +

              "50. And they planned a plan, and We  " +
                  "planned a plan, while they perceived  " +
                  "not.  \n" + "\n" +
          
              "51. See, then, what was the end of  " +
                  "their plan, that We destroyed them  " +
                  "and their people, all (of them). \n" + "\n" +
          
              "52. So those are their houses fallen  " +
                  "down because they were iniquitous.  " +
                  "Surely there is a sign in this for a  " +
                  "people who know. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "53. And We delivered those who  " +
                  "believed and kept their duty. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "54. And Lot, when he said to his  " +
                  "people: Do you commit foul deeds,  " +
                  "while you see?  \n" + "\n" +
          
              "55. Will you come to men lustfully  " +
                  "rather than women? Nay, you are a  " +
                  "people who act ignorantly. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "56. But the answer of his people was  " +
                  "naught except that they said: Drive  " +

              "57. But We delivered him and his  " +
                  "followers except his wife; We ordained  " +
                  "her to be of those who remained  " +

              "58. And We rained on them a rain; so  " +
                  "evil was the rain on those who had  " +

              "21. So he went forth therefrom,  " +

                  "towards Midian, he said: Maybe my  " +
                  "Lord will guide me in the right path. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "23. And when he came to the water  " +
                  "of Midian, he found there a group of  " +
                  "men watering, and he found besides  " +
                  "them two women keeping back (their  " +
                  "flocks). He said: What is the matter  " +
                  "with you? They said: We cannot  " +
                  "water until the shepherds take away  " +
                  "(their sheep) from the water; and our  " +
                  "father is a very old man.  \n" + "\n" +
          
              "24. So he watered (their sheep) for  " +
                  "them, then went back to the shade, and  " +
                  "said: My Lord, I stand in need of  " +
                  "whatever good Thou mayest send to me. \n" + "\n" +
          
              "25. Then one of the two women came  " +
                  "to him walking bashfully. She said: My  " +
                  "father a invites thee that he may reward  " +
                  "thee for having watered for us. So  " +
                  "when he came to him and related to  " +
                  "him the story, he said: Fear not, thou  " +

              "26. One of them said: O my father,  " +
                  "employ him; surely the best of those  " +
                  "that thou canst employ is the strong,  " +
                  "the faithful one.  \n" + "\n" +
          
              "2. He said: I desire to marry one of  " +

                  "condition that thou serve me for eight  " +
                  "years; but, if thou complete ten, it will  " +
                  "be of thy own free will, and I wish not  " +
                  "to be hard on thee. If Allåh please, thou  " +

                  "terms I fulfil, there will be no injustice " +

              "29. Then when Moses had completed  " +
                  "the term, and was travelling with his  " +
                  "family, he perceived a fire on the side  " +
                  "of the mountain. He said to his family: " +
                  "Wait, I see a fire; maybe I will  " +
                  "bring to you from it some news or a  " +

              "30. And when he came to it, he was  " +
                  "called from the right side of the valley " +
                  "in the blessed spot of the bush: O  " +
                  "Moses, surely I am Allåh, the Lord of  " +
                  "the worlds:  \n" + "\n" +

                  "he saw it in motion as if it were a  " +
                  "erpent, he turned away retreating, and  " +
                  "looked not back. O Moses, come forward " +
                  "and fear not; surely thou art of  " +

                  "will come forth white without evil,  " +
                  "and remain calm in fear. These two  " +
                  "are two arguments from thy Lord to " +
                  "Pharaoh and his chiefs. Surely they  " +

              "34. And my brother, Aaron, he is  " +
                  "more eloquent in speech than I, so  " +
                  "send him with me as a helper to  " +
