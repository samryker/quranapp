                 "no other than that they said: Turn  " +
                 "them out of your town; surely they  " +
                 "are a people who aspire to purity! \n" + "\n" +
     
           "83.  So We delivered him and his " +

                 "of those who remained behind. \n" + "\n" +
     
           "84.  And We rained upon them a  " +

                 "the guilty! \n" + "\n" +
     
           "85.  And to Midian (We sent) their " +
                 "brother Shu‘aib. He said: O my people, " +
                 "serve Allåh, you have no god  " +
                 "other than Him. Clear proof indeed  " +
                 "has come to you from your Lord, so  " +
                 "give full measure and weight and  " +
                 "diminish not to men their things, and  " +
                 "make not mischief in the land after  " +
                 "its reform. This is better for you, if  " +
                 "you are believers.a \n" + "\n" +
     
           "86.  And lie not in wait on every road,  " +
                 "threatening and turning away from " +
                 "Allåh’s way him who believes in Him " +
                 "and seeking to make it crooked. And  " +
                 "remember when you were few, then  " +
                 "He multiplied you, and see what was  " +
                 "the end of the mischief-makers! \n" + "\n" +
     
           "87.  And if there is a party of you who  " +
                 "believe in that wherewith I am sent  " +
                 "and another party who believe not,  " +
                 "then wait patiently till Allåh judges  " +
                 "between us; and He is the Best of  " +
                 "Judges. \n" + "\n" +
     
           "88.  The arrogant chiefs of his people  " +
                 "said: We will certainly turn thee out,  " +
                 "O Shu‘aib, and those who believe  " +
                 "with thee from our town, or you shall  " +
                 "come back to our religion. He said:  " +
                 "Even though we dislike (it)?  \n" + "\n" +
     
           "89.  Indeed we should have forged a  " +
                 "lie against Allåh, if we go back to  " +
                 "your religion after Allåh has delivered " +
                 "us from it. And it is not for us to  " +
                 "go back to it, unless Allåh our Lord  " +
                 "please. Our Lord comprehends all  " +

           "90.  And the chiefs of his people, who  " +
                 "disbelieved, said: If you follow  " +
                 "Shu‘aib, you are surely losers. \n" + "\n" +
     
           "91.  So the earthquake overtook them,  " +
                 "and they were motionless  " +

           "92.  Those who called Shu‘aib a liar  " +
                 "were as though they had never dwelt  " +
                 "therein — those who called Shu‘aib a  " +
                 "liar, they were the losers. \n" + "\n" +
     
           "93.  So he turned away from them and  " +
                 "said: O my people, indeed I delivered  " +
                 "to you the messages of my Lord and  " +
                 "I gave you good advice; how, then,  " +

                 "people?a \n" + "\n" +
     
           "94.  And We did not send a prophet to " +
                 "a town but We seized its people with  " +
                 "distress and affliction that they might  " +
                 "humble themselves.a \n" + "\n" +
     
           "95.  Then We changed the evil for  " +
                 "good,a till they became affluent and  " +
                 "said: Distress and happiness did indeed  " +

                 "surprise while they perceived not. \n" + "\n" +
     
           "96.  And if the people of the towns  " +
                 "had believed and kept their duty, We  " +
                 "would certainly have opened for  " +
                 "them blessings from the heavens and  " +
                 "the earth. But they rejected, so We  " +
                 "seized them for what they earned.  \n" + "\n" +
     
           "97.  Are the people of the towns, then,  " +
                 "secure from Our punishment coming  " +
                 "to them by night while they sleep? \n" + "\n" +
     
           "98.  Or, are the people of the towns  " +

          "100.  Is it not clear to those who  " +
                 "inherit the earth after its (former)  " +
                 "residents that, if We please, We would  " +

                 "their hearts so they would not hear? \n" + "\n" +
     
          "101.  Such were the towns some of  " +

                 "And certainly their messengers came  " +
                 "to them with clear arguments, but  " +
                 "they would not believe what they had  " +

                 "the hearts of the disbelievers. \n" + "\n" +
     
          "102.  And We found not in most of  " +

                 "We found most of them to be transgressors. \n" + "\n" +
     
          "103.  Then, after them, We sent  " +
                 "Moses with Our messages to Pharaoh  " +
                 "and his chiefs, but they disbelieved  " +
                 "them. See, then, what was the end of  " +
                 "the mischief-makers!a \n" + "\n" +
     
          "104.  And Moses said: O Pharaoh,  " +

                 "come to you indeed with clear proof  " +
                 "from your Lord, so let the Children  " +

          "107.  So he threw his rod, then lo! it  " +
                 "was a serpent manifest. \n" + "\n" +

                 "lo! it was white to the beholders.a \n" + "\n" +
          
          "109.  The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people  " +
                 "said: Surely this is a skilful enchanter! \n" + "\n" +

                 "your land. What do you advise?a \n" + "\n" +
          
          "111.  They said: Put him off and his  " +

          "113.  And the enchanters came to  " +
                 "Pharaoh, saying: We must surely  " +
                 "have a reward if we prevail.a \n" + "\n" +
          
          "114.  He said: Yes, and you shall " +

                 "me). \n" + "\n" +

          "116.  He said: Cast. So when they  " +

          "119.  There they were vanquished,  " +

                 "surely we are dominant over them.a \n" + "\n" +
     
          "128.  Moses said to his people: Ask  " +

                 "Surely the land is Allåh’s — He  " +

          "130.  And certainly We overtook  " +
                 "Pharaoh’s people with droughts and  " +
                 "diminution of fruits that they might  " +

          "131.  But when good befell them they  " +
                 "said: This is due to us. And when evil  " +
                 "afflicted them, they attributed it to  " +
                 "the ill-luck of Moses and those with  " +

          "136.  So We exacted retribution from  " +

                    "when he talked with him, he said: " +

             "58.   And Joseph’s brethren came and " +
                    "went in to him, and he knew them, " +
                    "while they recognized him not. \n" + "\n" +
                    
             "59.   And when he furnished them with " +
                    "their provision, he said: Bring to me a " +
                    "brother of yours from your father. See " +
                    "you not that I give full measure and " +
                    "that I am the best of hosts? \n" + "\n" +
                    
             "60.   But if you bring him not to me, " +
                    "you shall have no measure (of corn) " +
                    "from me, nor shall you come near me. \n" + "\n" +
                    
             "61.   They said: We shall strive to " +
                    "make his father yield about him, and " +
                    "we are sure to do (it). \n" + "\n" +
                    
             "62.   And he said to his servants: Put " +
                    "their moneya into their bags that they " +
                    "may recognize it when they go back " +
                    "to their family, so that they may " +

             "63.   So when they returned to their " +
                    "father, they said: O our father, the " +
                    "measure is withheld from us, so send " +
                    "with us our brother that we may get " +
                    "the measure, and we will surely " +
                    "guard him. \n" + "\n" +
                    
             "64.   He said: Can I trust you with " +
                    "him, except as I trusted you with his " +
                    "brother before? So Allåh is the Best " +
                    "Keeper, and He is the most Merciful " +
                    "of those who show mercy. \n" + "\n" +
                    
             "65.   And when they opened their " +
                    "goods, they found their money " +
                    "returned to them. They said: O our " +
                    "father, what (more) can we desire? " +
                    "This is our property returned to us, " +
                    "and we shall bring corn for our family  " +
                    "and guard our brother, and have in " +
                    "addition the measure of a camel-load. " +
                    "This is an easy measure. \n" + "\n" +
                    
             "66.   He said: I will by no means send " +
                    "him with you, until you give me a firm " +
                    "covenant in Allåh’s name that you will " +
                    "bring him back to me, unless you are " +
                    "completely surrounded. And when " +
                    "they gave him their covenant, he said: " +
                    "Allåh is Guardian over what we say. \n" + "\n" +
                    
             "67.   And he said: O my sons, enter " +

                    "gates.a And I can avail you naught " +
                    "against Allåh. Judgment is only " +

             "68.   And when they entered as their " +
                    "father had bidden them, it availed " +
                    "them naught against Allåh, but (it " +
                    "was only) a desire in the soul of " +
                    "Jacob, which he satisfied. And surely " +
                    "he was possessed of knowledge, " +
                    "because We had given him knowledge, " +
                    " but most people know not.a \n" + "\n" +
 
             "69.   And when they went in to Joseph, " +
                    "he lodged his brother with himself, " +
                    "saying: I am thy brother, so grieve " +
                    "not at what they do. \n" + "\n" +
 
             "70.   Then when he furnished them " +
                    "with their provision, (someone) " +
                    "placed the drinking-cup in his brother’s bag.a " +
                    "Then a crier cried out:b O " +
                    "caravan, you are surely thieves!  \n" + "\n" +
 
             "71.   They said, while they turned " +
                    "towards them: What is it that you " +
                    "miss? \n" + "\n" +
                    
             "72.   They said: We miss the king’s " +
                    "drinking-cup, and he who brings it " +
                    "shall have a camel-load, and I am " +
                    "responsible for it. \n" + "\n" +
                    
             "73.   They said: By Allåh! You know " +
                    "for certain that we have not come to " +
                    "make mischief in the land, and we " +
                    "are not thieves. \n" + "\n" +
                    
             "74.   They said: But what is the penalty " +
                    " for this, if you are liars? \n" + "\n" +
                    
             "75.   They said: The penalty for this — " +
                    "the person in whose bag it is found, " +
                    "he himself is the penalty for it. Thus " +

             "76.   So he began with their sacks " +
                    "before the sack of his brother,a then " +
                    "he brought it out from his brother’s " +

                    "Allåh pleased. We raise in degree " +
                    "whom We please. And above everyone " +

             "77.   They said: If he steal, a brother of " +
                    "his did indeed steal before.a But " +
                    "Joseph kept it secret in his soul, and " +
                    "disclosed it not to them. He said: " +

             "78.   They said: O chief, he has a " +

             "80.   So when they despaired of him, " +
                    "they conferred together privately. " +
                    "The eldest of them said: Know you " +
                    "not that your father took from you a " +

                    "you fell short of your duty about " +
                    "Joseph before? So I shall not leave " +
                    "this land, until my father permits me " +

             "81.   Go back to your father and say: O " +

                    "And we bear witness only to what we " +

             "82.   And ask the town where we were, " +

                    "And surely we are truthful. \n" + "\n" +
                    
             "83.   He said: Nay, your souls have " +

                    "patience is good. Maybe Allåh will " +

                    "and said: O my sorrow for Joseph! " +
                    "And his eyes were filleda (with tears) " +

             "61.   So when they reached the junction " +

                    "their fish, and it took its way into the  " +

             "62.   But when they had gone further,  " +
                    "he said to his servant: Bring to us our  " +

             "63.   He said: Sawest thou when we  " +
                    "took refuge on the rock, I forgot the  " +
                    "fish, and none but the devil made me  " +
                    "forget to speak of it, and it took its  " +
                    "way into the river; what a wonder!a \n" + "\n" +
       
             "64.   He said: This is what we sought  " +
                    "for. So they returned retracing their  " +
                    "footsteps. \n" + "\n" +
       
             "65.   Then they found one of Our  " +
                    "servants whom We had granted mercy  " +
                    "from Us and whom We had taught  " +
                    "knowledge from Ourselves. \n" + "\n" +
       
             "66.   Moses said to him: May I follow  " +

             "67.   He said: Thou canst not have  " +
                    "patience with me. \n" + "\n" +
       
             "68.   And how canst thou have  " +

             "69.   He said: If Allåh please, thou wilt  " +

                    "until I myself speak to thee about it. \n" + "\n" +
       
             "71.   So they set out until, when they  " +
                    "embarked in a boat, he made a hole in  " +
                    "it. (Moses) said: Hast thou made a  " +
                    "hole in it to drown its occupants? Thou  " +

             "72.   He said: Did I not say that thou  " +
                    "couldst not have patience with me?  \n" + "\n" +
       
             "73.   He said: Blame me not for what I  " +
                    "forgot, and be not hard upon me for  " +
                    "what I did. \n" + "\n" +
       
             "74.   So they went on, until, when they  " +
                    "met a boy, he slew him. (Moses) said:  " +
                    "Hast thou slain an innocent person,  " +
                    "not guilty of slaying another? Thou  " +
                    "hast indeed done a horrible thing. \n" + "\n" +
       
             "75.   He said: Did I not say to thee that  " +

                    "with me. Thou wilt then indeed have  " +
                    "found an excuse in my case. \n" + "\n" +
       
             "77.   So they went on, until, when they  " +
                    "came to the people of a town, they  " +
                    "asked its people for food, but they  " +
                    "refused to entertain them as guests.  " +
                    "Then they found in it a wall which  " +
                    "was on the point of falling, so he put it  " +
                    "into a right state. (Moses) said: If thou  " +
                    "hadst wished, thou couldst have taken  " +
                    "a recompense for it. \n" + "\n" +
       
             "78.   He said: This is the parting  " +
                    "between me and thee. Now I will  " +
                    "inform thee of the significance of that  " +

             "79.   As for the boat, it belonged to  " +
                    "poor people working on the river,  " +
                    "and I intended to damage it, for there  " +
                    "was behind them a king who seized  " +
                    "every boat by force. \n" + "\n" +
       
             "80.   And as for the boy, his parents  " +
                    "were believers and we feared lest he  " +
                    "should involve them in wrongdoing  " +

             "81.   So we intended that their Lord  " +

                    "in purity and nearer to mercy. \n" + "\n" +
       
             "82.   And as for the wall, it belonged to  " +
                    "two orphan boys in the city, and there  " +
                    "was beneath it a treasure belonging to  " +
                    "them, and their father had been a  " +

             "85.   So he followed a course. \n" + "\n" +
